PROCEDURES FOR BACKING UP THE GENGIS SVN

(1) Log into Kiwi (kiwi.research.cs.dal.ca)

(2) Make a 'hotcopy' of the repository to another location on the same machine (e.g., home directory):
 
  svnadmin hotcopy /Users/gengis/Sites/GenGIS/code/repos ~/repos-backup

(3) Copy the backup to another server (e.g., MOA)

  scp -r ~/repos-backup <USERNAME>@moa.hpc.dal.ca:repos-backup

  [the system will ask for your password]

That's it!


OTHER STUFF:

Finding the size of a directory:
  du -h repos-backup

Repository location on Kiwi:
  /Users/gengis/Sites/GenGIS/code/repos
